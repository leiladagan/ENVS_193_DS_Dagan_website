### Where I'm From

I was born on Maui, Hawaii and I lived there until I was five. Then, I grew up in a small town called Brookdale nestled in the Santa Cruz mountains! I was lucky enough to live in two places with spectacular nature. My upbringing definitely fostered a love and respect for the environment, inspiring me to get my degree in environmental studies.

### My Current Favorite Book

I recently read *Sharks in the time of Saviors* by Kawai Strong Washburn, and would love to chat about it with anyone willing to listen!
