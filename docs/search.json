    "text": "I am a student worker for the Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration. In this, we remove invasive plants using different techniques, such as solarization, manual removal, controlled burns, and careful use of grass specific herbicide. We also collect seeds from local native plants in order to spread to other areas around campus and increase the local plant biodiversity. I have learned a lot about the different native plants in the Isla Vista area, as well as useful land management strategies.\n\n\n{=html}  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is where I park to work at the Ellwood Marine Terminal! This is one of the newer sites, where we are planting for the butterfly grove as well as plants that will act as filtration for the riparian zone nearby.\n\n\n\nThis is where most of my work takes place, as my boss is the Lagoon steward. Here, we are mostly removing invasive species.\n\n\n\n\nThis site was burned in the Summer of 2024, right before I started working for CCBER. It was burned with the intent to heat and kill the invasive grasses and their seeds, and to test out different treatments for restoration. Over the course of this school year, we have monitored how the different subplots (high native seeding, low seed, no seed) are blooming after the burn, as well as the recovery of shrubs that survived the burn. There is a control plot a thatch-removed plot, and a grass-specific herbicide plot nearby that are monitored simultaneously. We also remove any invasive plants that popped up after the burn.\n\n\n\n\nThis was the first site I worked on with CCBER, so it’s near and dear to my heart. Lots of planting and weeding!\n\n\n\nThis project has a lot of sky and bush lupines, which have become my favorite flowers! Also lots of planting, weeding, and seed collecting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn amazing spot to tidepool and surf! I didn’t know about this place until my second year at UCSB, but now I can’t get enough!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis grassy park is a lovely place to tan, do homework outside, and people watch.\n\n\n\nAnother lovely grassy area to hang out in Isla Vista, I usually stop here on my walk to Dev’s.\n\n\n\nWhere I fell in love with surfing my freshman year. I was able to see bioluminescence here and I have never felt more like a mermaid. .\n\n\n\nThe best place to study! A beautiful outdoor ocean view deck."
