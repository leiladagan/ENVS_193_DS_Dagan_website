In this, we remove invasive plants using different techniques, such as solarization, manual removal, controlled burns, and careful use of grass specific herbicide. We also collect seeds from local native plants in order to spread to other areas around campus and increase the local plant biodiversity. I have learned a lot about the different native plants in the Isla Vista area, as well as useful land management strategies.\n\n\n{=html}"
