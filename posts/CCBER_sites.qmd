I am a student worker for the Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration. In this, we remove invasive plants using different techniques, such as solarization, manual removal, controlled burns, and careful use of grass specific herbicide. We also collect seeds from local native plants in order to spread to other areas around campus and increase the local plant biodiversity. I have learned a lot about the different native plants in the Isla Vista area, as well as useful land management strategies.

# Ellwood Marine Terminal:

This is where I park to work at the Ellwood Marine Terminal! This is one of the newer sites, where we are planting coast live oaks and eucalyptus trees for the butterfly grove as well as other native plants that will act as filtration for the riparian zone nearby.

# Lagoon Island:

This is where most of my work takes place, as my boss is the Lagoon steward. Here, we are mostly removing invasive species such as *bromus diandrus*, *festuca myuros*, *erodium botrys*, *lysimachia arvensis*, and more.

# Burn Plot:

This site was burned in the Summer of 2024, right before I started working for CCBER. It was burned with the intent to heat and kill the invasive grasses and their seeds, and to test out different treatments for restoration. Over the course of this school year, we have monitored how the different subplots (high native seeding, low seed, no seed) are blooming after the burn, as well as the recovery of shrubs that survived the burn. There is a control plot a thatch-removed plot, and a grass-specific herbicide plot nearby that are monitored simultaneously. We also remove any invasive plants that popped up after the burn.

# Campus Point:

This was the first site I worked on with CCBER, so it's near and dear to my heart. Lots of planting and weeding!

# Henley Gate:

This project has a lot of sky and bush lupines, which have become my favorite flowers! Also lots of planting, weeding, and seed collecting.
