# Devereux:

An amazing spot to tidepool and surf! I didn't know about this place until my second year at UCSB, but now I can't get enough!

# Del Playa Park

This grassy park is a lovely place to tan, do homework outside, and people watch.

# Window to the Sea Park

Another lovely grassy area to hang out in Isla Vista, I usually stop here on my walk to Dev's.

# Campus point (again)

Where I fell in love with surfing my freshman year. I was able to see bioluminescence here and I have never felt more like a mermaid.

The best place to study! A beautiful outdoor ocean view deck.
